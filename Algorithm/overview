Card layout:
Each card will be given the following attributes:
    Content (the exercise/ word etc)
    Date of first access (the date on which the card was first loaded (changed from Null to A))
    Category
    Date of category change (the date on which the category changed from the previous one to the current)

Algorithm:
Upon first being used, assigns date of first use
Fetches new cards (number specified by the user in the settings; default 10)
Assigns date of first access
Starts counter for the start of the study session
Assigns category:
    Based of places in the fibonacci sequence:
    (The first 3 categories are for use during the initial study session, if the study session
    is cancelled before they reach category 1, then the cards will be reset to 'Null').
    Null - A card that has not been used
    0.1* - 1 minute
    0.2 - 3 minutes
    0.3 - 5 minutes
    1 - 1 day
    2 - 2 days
    3 - 3 days
    4 - 5 days
    etc...
    * 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 are used for the first stages of the card, rather than 'A,B' and 'C', due to simplicity of implementation in SQL: it is
    easier to manipulate decimal numbers and have all categories of the same type than have two separate values, one for
    category - as an integer - and one for the first 3 categories - as text.
    Up to the point where the card is considered to be in 'long term memory'
    (6 months: https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-best-spaced-repetition-schedule)
Checks days elapsed since date of first use
Checks the category of each card; check if the current date is within the range for that
card to be called, based on its category:
    For example, if a card was assigned category 4 on the 20-4-2020, then it would be next called
    on 24-4-2020. If the current date were 23-4-2020, then that card would not be called.
If the user gets the answer wrong:
    Reset category back to 0
If the user gets the answer correct:
    Move the category forward 1
After each card, the time since elapsed since the start of the study session is checked:
    The time is rounded to the nearest minute.
